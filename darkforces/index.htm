<font face="Arial">Star Wars: Dark Forces, legendary space shooter from 1995 by 
LucsArts. The game was made for MS-DOS, and therefore requires an emulator, 
like DOSBox, to run on a modern PC with Win7/8/10. However, with this program you can run 
Dark Forces directly from Windows instead of using an emulator, and play with 3D acceleration in scaled full-screen at any resolution.<b><br>

<font face="Impact" size="6">GAME INFO</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">Star Wars: Dark Forces was the first game in the Jedi Knight series, 
and the first serious first-person shooter game for the franchise. It was both 
developed and released by LucasArts in 1665 for MS DOS. The story follows Kyle 
Katarn, a mercenary working for the Rebel Alliance, who discovers the &quot;Dark 
Trooper Project&quot;. The Empire is planning and developing of a series of very 
powerful new droids and some better armors for the storm-troopers. The game uses 
it's own engine, the Jedi game engine, which has many similarities with the DooM 
engine. Dark Forces received good reviews from both fans and critics, and was 
especially praised for it's level design.<br>
Star Wars: Dark Forces follows the storyline without player-choices. The player 
starts every level with a mission briefing and/or a cut-scene. Each mission has 
specific objectives, which must be completed. The missions take place in 
different environments in the Star Wars universe, including a Star Destroyer, 
Jabba's space yacht, and the planet Coruscant.<br>
The game was actually the first FPS to introduce jumping and looking up and 
down. These new features brought more depth and freedom to the game, and has 
become standard for FPS games today. This, plus the fact that the game had a 
story, made it different to Doom and most other FPS games at the time. The 
fighting and shooting mechanics are pretty standard, and the way the level 
design works is also typical for it's time. The game does however have a certain 
charm that makes it worth playing today, even though time has caught up with the 
graphics and game-play. Dark Forces is one of those titles that will be 
remembered, both because it was very solid when it came out, but also because it 
was the first serious Star Wars game. It was a MUST HAVE in 1995.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">Star Wars: Dark Forces is a first-person shooter video game 
developed and published by LucasArts in 1995. The game is set in the Star Wars 
universe and takes place between the events of the original Star Wars film and 
its sequel, The Empire Strikes Back.<br>
<br>
The gameplay in Dark Forces is similar to other first-person shooters of its 
time, with players controlling the character Kyle Katarn as they navigate 
through levels, battling enemies and solving puzzles. The game features a 
variety of weapons, including blaster pistols, blaster rifles, and thermal 
detonators, as well as a variety of enemies, such as stormtroopers, droid 
soldiers, and Dark Jedi.<br>
<br>
The story of Dark Forces follows Kyle Katarn, a former Imperial agent who 
becomes a mercenary for the Rebel Alliance. The game's plot centers around the 
Empire's secret development of a new superweapon known as the Dark Trooper 
project. Kyle is tasked with infiltrating the Empire's bases and gathering 
information about the project, ultimately leading to a final confrontation with 
the Empire's top scientists and the Dark Troopers themselves.<br>
<br>
The characters in the game include Kyle Katarn, the game's protagonist, and Jan 
Ors, Kyle's partner and love interest. The game also features several notable 
Star Wars characters such as Mon Mothma, General Jan Dodonna, and Darth Vader.<br>
<br>
The graphics of the game were state-of-the-art for its time, featuring detailed 
textures and 3D models. The game's engine allowed for a high degree of 
environmental interactivity, such as the ability to destroy certain objects in 
the game world and the ability to look up and down.<br>
<br>
The development of Star Wars: Dark Forces was led by game designer Justin Chin 
and a team of developers at LucasArts. The game was met with positive reviews 
from critics and players, and was praised for its immersive story, action-packed 
gameplay, and its ability to capture the feeling of the Star Wars universe. The 
success of the game led to the creation of several sequels and spin-offs, 
including the Jedi Knight series.<br>
<br>
Overall, Star Wars: Dark Forces is a classic first-person shooter that is still 
remembered fondly by fans of the Star Wars franchise and the FPS genre. Its 
immersive story, action-packed gameplay, and high-quality graphics make it a 
must-play for fans of Star Wars and first-person shooters alike. With the game's 
recent release on modern platforms, it's the perfect time to experience this 
Star Wars classic and see where the franchise's first-person shooter legacy 
began.</font></p>
