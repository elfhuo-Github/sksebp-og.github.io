<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">This very first serious Aliens vs Predator 
game for PC was recently re-released on Steam and GOG as &quot;Aliens vs Predator 
Classic 2000&quot;. The game was not exactly revolutionary back in 1999 at it's first 
release, but it was a solid game and it had an interesting angle to it's 
single-player campaigns. The game could be played as any of the 3 opposing 
species, Aliens, Human or Predator. This Redux mod is ONLY for the Aliens vs 
Predator Classic 2000 (Steam and GOG re-release), NOT the original CD version of 
the game. It includes new HD textures, more detailed 3Dmodels and a modified ENB 
render similar to the one used in the Deus Ex Revision project.<br>

Aliens versus Predator was developed by Rebellion and released in 1999 by Fox 
Interactive. It was made with the same game idea in mind as the 1994 Aliens vs 
Predator release for Atari Jaguar. The game has 3 separate campaigns, which 
allows the player to take control of each species. Aliens, Marines &amp; Predator. 
This take on single-player campaigns was new, and got a lot of positive 
feedback. Technically the game was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The 
game mostly stood out due to it's 3-way-split campaigns and it's atmosphere. 
Today the graphics and mechanics of the game are outdated and far from 
impressive compared to resent games. This redux project will not bring the game 
up to par in any way, but it helps a lot on replayability. It comes with new 
textures and models plus a new render. The game design and levels are still 
extremely simple, and the effects are not exactly stunning, but the game still 
has the creepy atmosphere and somehow manages to be fun to play, even today.<br>
Plot (Spoiler alert): The storylines in each campaign is completely independent 
of one another. As a Colonial Marine, the player starts the story at a research 
station on LV-426. The humans are studying the alien spacecraft at the location 
where the first Alien eggs were found in the 1979 movie, Alien. Things of course 
don't go according to plan, and everyone are attacked by the Aliens. The player 
must fight his/her way through the research facility, the alien space-ship and a 
second colony. Here the player tries to shutdown the cooling-system to cause an 
explosion and wipe out all the Aliens at once. After finishing up on LV-426, the 
player escapes in a drop-ship and flies to a nearby space-station. Here the 
battle continues against both Aliens, Predators, face-huggers, cybernetically-enhanced 
super-aliens and even an Alien/Predator hybrid. At last the player faces the 
Alien queen, which concludes the human campaign.<br>
As an Alien, the player is given the task of defend the Alien hive from human 
invaders. Ultimately the player must hide on an evacuating spaceship and get 
onboard the human marines mother-ship. After doing what Aliens do, the 
self-destruct system is activated and the player must reach an escape shuttle. 
Next place is a Gateway Station where the player annihilates more human marines, 
and finally reaching a spaceship that is departing for Earth. Two Predators must 
however be defeated before the player can enter the shuttle to Earth.<br>
As a Predator the story unfolds on three different planets. At first the player 
is hunting human marines while recovering a captured Predator spaceship from a 
human military base. Aliens are attacking the base at the same time, and the 
player discovers that the humans have created an Alien/Predator hybrid. During 
the fight against the hybrid, the facility's self-destruct mechanism is 
triggered, and the player has to escape in the Predator spaceship. This takes 
the player to Fiorina &quot;Fury&quot; 161, the prison planet from the 1992 Alien 3 movie. 
Here more Aliens and marines are fighting, and the player reaches a 
marine-controlled Alien habitat with cybernetically-enhanced Aliens and an Alien 
Queen.</font></p>
