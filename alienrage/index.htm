<br>
Alien Rage is great game from 2013. 
Unfortunately the Steam version has an error that prevents it from launching on 
modern computer systems. The developers and the team at Steam seems to have 
abandoned the game completely, even though they still sell it. The error is 
caused by the &quot;steam_api.dll&quot; file, so I'm not entirely sure if that's a fault 
of Steam or the developers from CI Games. Regardless, the error is easily fixed 
by replacing the file.<br>

<font face="Impact" size="6">GAME INFO</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">Alien Rage is a first-person shooter video game developed by 
CI Games and published by City Interactive. The game is set in the distant 
future, where Earth's resources have been depleted, and humanity must turn to 
the stars to find new resources. The game follows a character named Jack, a 
member of an elite squad sent to a distant planet to extract valuable resources, 
but soon finds himself caught up in a war between humans and an alien race known 
as the &quot;Prometheans.&quot;<br>
<br>
The gameplay of Alien Rage is fast-paced and action-packed, with players taking 
on the role of Jack as they battle their way through hordes of alien enemies, 
using a variety of powerful weapons and abilities. The game features a wide 
variety of weapons, including traditional firearms such as assault rifles and 
shotguns, as well as more exotic weapons like energy guns and plasma cannons. 
The game also features a variety of special abilities, such as the ability to 
slow down time and the ability to unleash a powerful energy blast that can take 
out multiple enemies at once.<br>
<br>
One of the most striking elements of the game is its visuals. Alien Rage 
features a highly detailed and realistic art style, with detailed textures and 
lighting effects that help to create a sense of immersion. The game's 
environments are also diverse and well-designed, ranging from industrial 
complexes to sprawling alien landscapes. The game's enemies are also 
well-designed, featuring a variety of different types of aliens, each with their 
own unique abilities and weaknesses.<br>
<br>
The game's development was led by CI Games, a Polish game development studio. 
The development team aimed to create a fast-paced and action-packed shooter that 
would appeal to fans of the genre. The game's development was not without its 
challenges, with the team facing a number of technical difficulties and delays, 
but ultimately, the game was released to positive reviews.<br>
<br>
Alien Rage was released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC in 2013. The game 
received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its 
fast-paced action, diverse weapons and abilities, and well-designed levels. Some 
reviewers criticized the game's lack of originality, but overall, it was 
considered a solid entry in the first-person shooter genre.<br>
<br>
Overall, Alien Rage is a game that offers a thrilling and engaging experience to 
players. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons and abilities, and 
impressive visuals, it offers players a unique and memorable gaming experience. 
The game's story and setting are also well-done, providing players with a sense 
of immersion and a compelling reason to keep playing. The game's development was 
challenging, but the final product is a game that is worth playing for fans of 
the first-person shooter genre. Alien Rage is a game that will stick with 
players long after they've finished it.<br>
Alien Rage is a first-person shooter with pretty linear levels. You meet many 
hostile aliens, and at the end of every few levels, there is a predictable boss 
fight. Very cliché. You get points for annihilating as many aliens as possible 
in the shortest amount of time. Regardless if you use explosions or bullets. No 
surprises. The player can use both human or alien weapons, which is cool but 
predictable as well. Assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, 
and miniguns, same as in every other 1st or 3rd person shooter. The game has 
competitive multiplayer, but no servers are running. The ironic thing is, the 
multiplayer version of the game actual works without a fix, but since the 
servers are not running, you can't play. The single-player version of the game, 
which doesn't require any running servers, doesn't work without the fix from 
this page. Brilliant. Alien Rage takes place on an asteroid for space-mining 
Promethium, a dangerous source of energy. Surprise. Jack, the player, is sent to 
the mining facility to destroy it, and wipe out the aliens as well. Because, why 
not have some fun.</font></p>
