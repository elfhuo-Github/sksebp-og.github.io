<p align="center"><font face="Impact" size="7">TEXTURE OPTIMIZATION</font></p>
<p align="left"style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px"><font face="Arial">
Texture optimization is done to save video memory at <b>no visual quality-loss.</b> 
This is done by several methods, individual for each texture and it's use. 
Typically by converting diffuse-maps to BC1/BC7 - DXT1/DXT5, and rescaling normal-maps and specular-maps.</font></p>
<p align="left"style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px"><font face="Arial">
<b>Scaling:</b><br>
Scaling textures according to the objects they cover, is more important than 
scaling according to screen resolution, contrary to popular belief. It's true that if you have a 
higher screen resolution, then you also need a bigger texture to cover the same 
object, but proper scaling in relation to the specific object is still far more 
important. As a rule of thumb, the texture size needed is twice the size of the 
amount of pixels that the object takes of the screen when showing. (With lots of 
exceptions of course)<br>
<u>Example:</u> The texture for a mug. This object is rather small, and will 
never take up a significant percentage of the screen. (Unless unusually 
closely examined) An object this size doesn't need a texture size that matches 
your screen resolution 
to look perfect. You will not gain any quality improvement what so ever by using a 
huge texture on a small object. The perfect texture size 
for a mug, using a 4k monitor, will therefore not be a 4k texture, but rather 
something like a 2k diffuse-map with 1k 
normal-maps &amp; 1k specular-maps.<br>
<u>Example:</u> The texture for a tree. This is a huge object, that can cover a 
large percentage of the screen, even without showing the entire object. This 
texture therefore needs to be bigger than your screen resolution. On a 4k monitor, the perfect size would 
probably be 8-16k, depending on your system recourses and your eye for detail.<br>
<b>Proper scaling:</b> The first and most important thing is to ensure that the 
texture looks good at 100% size in 2D. Meaning, resize according to the quality 
of the texture without thinking of the object. When 
quality is perfect, then the size needs to be compared to the object. If still 
too big (This rarely happens) then it can be downsized further.<br>
This is unfortunately a very common issue with texture mods.
A lot of mod authors (even Bethesda themselves) do a little &quot;cheating&quot; when 
making HD textures. They take a 2k texture, and simply stretch it in Photoshop 
to make it 4k. This is completely useless. A 4k texture that is made by 
stretching a 2k texture, will look 100% identical in-game. Absolutely no 
difference what so ever, not even a little. The only difference is that the 4k 
texture wastes 4 times the amount of video memory. The reason they do it, is 
because it looks better to state that the textures are 4k. A cheap little 
marketing 
trick, which unfortunately is very common. However, when 
loaded into Photoshop, these &quot;fake&quot; HD textures are easily spotted, and can be downsized again without problems.</font></p>
<p align="left"style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px"><font face="Arial">
<b>Compression:</b><br>
Another common mistake, is missing or wrong texture compression. If a texture is 
compressed where it shouldn't be, or left uncompressed where it actually could be 
optimized, the quality won't be optimal, and the mod may take up way more video memory than 
needed. This is very common too.<br>
Memory-usage by formats:<br>
Uncompressed 32-bit ARGB 4k texture size = 64mb<br>
Uncompressed 24-bit RGB 4k texture size = 44mb<br>
BC7/DXT5 with alpha (transparency) 4k texture size = 22mb<br>
BC1/DXT1 no alpha 4k texture size = 11mb<br>
<b>Proper compression:</b> With hundreds of textures loaded at the same time, 
quite a lot of video memory can be saved by having proper compression. However, 
not all textures can be compressed without quality-loss, so it's very important 
only to compress the right texture types, and to take pixel-size into consideration as 
well.</font></p>
<p align="left"style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px"><font face="Arial">
<b>Texture types - Diffuse-maps:</b><br>
These are textures that put an image on the surface of an object. They are 
needed for every single object in the game, and are the most important textures. 
Without a diffuse-map, the object would be all pink. This texture can <i>usually</i> 
be compressed with BC1/DXT1 or BC7/DXT5 without any visual difference in the game. On a 
close-up screenshot you <i>may,</i> or may not, notice a tiny difference (not 
necessarily worse), but that's it.<br>
<b>Texture types - Normal-maps:</b><br>
These textures are light-pointers. They provide a map of how light should look 
on the texture, making it look like a real surface, nut just a flat image 
wrapped around an object. These typically needs to be either left uncompressed 
or, depending on the object of use, compressed with BC7/DXT5.<br>
<b>Texture types - Specular-maps:</b><br>
These textures determine the amount of shine and where. Typically used to make 
objects look wet, or to simulate a certain material. As these usually consist of 
dot-like points and lines rather than large smooth ranges, BC7/DXT5 can be used in 
99% of cases for these.</font></p>
<p align="left"style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px"><font face="Arial">
<b>Aim of SSEBP texture compression:</b><br>
To save as much video memory as possible without loss of quality, minded for 
1080p/2160p.<br>
Example of a standard optimal texture set: 4k diffuse-map compressed with 
BC1/BC7 - DXT1/DXT5, 2k normal-map compressed with BC7/DXT5/uncompressed, and 2k specular-map 
with BC7/DXT5 compression.<br>
*Optimal compression/scale varies depending on object size/type, the 
original texture quality, and in-game use/location.</font></p>
