<font face="Arial">
The Skyrim SE Beautification Project is a complete visual 
overhaul of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition. It comes with step-by-step instructions, no modding experience required. 
All you need is patience and a good internet connection.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px">
<font face="Arial">
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the best open-world RPG's ever made. 
The Special Edition updated the engine to 64bit and came with a few minor effect 
improvements, but it was hardly the &quot;remake&quot; that people were hoping for. Sure, 
the game looked slightly better than the original Legendary Edition, but not 
enough to justify buying the game twice. No bug-fixes, no HD textures, no new content and no character 
improvements. Just slightly better 
environmental effects, which couldn't compare to what the modding community 
had already made. This guide aims to fix all that, and bring the changes 
that the game deserves.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px">
<font face="Arial">
<b>Visual improvements: </b>Better lighting and 
effects, HD textures (4k-2k), high-poly 3D models, better weather system.<br>
<b>Performance:</b> Better memory handling, texture optimizations (Details: 
<a target="_blank" href="texture/index.htm">LINK</a>), and ENB performance 
version.<br>
<b>Added content:</b> New lands, dungeons, buildings, races, characters and quests. 
Lore-friendly and true to the style of the game.<br>
<b>Stability: </b>Error fixes and mod compatibility patches. Every mod has been 
tested for stability, fps-impact, script errors and conflicts with other mods.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px">
<font face="Arial">
The modding community for Skyrim is huge, and it's a very time consuming process to figure out which mods 
to use together, and how to make a compatible setup which is both lore-friendly 
and stable. This guide took several months of researching and testing. The 
custom ENB settings have been fine-tuned to work 
without other lighting mods, which gives it a performance edge compared to 
most other ENB's.<br>
<br>
<b>The Skyrim SE Beautification Project will give Skyrim the proper make-over 
that Special Edition / Anniversary Edition <i>should</i> have given. The game will 
look like a modern release, and it will run more stable at the same time.<br>

<b>About The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and the 
world of Tamriel</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px">
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a first-person RPG from 
Bethesda Game Studios, released in 2011. (Special Edition, 2016) The main storyline 
follows the Drogonborn's hunt for Alduin, a black dragon, who according to myth will destroy Tamriel 
and the rest of the world. On the 
journey, the player has a huge variety of side-quests and choices, some of which 
will impacts the world, some of which that won't. The story starts at a time 
where Skyrim is at the brink of civil war between the invading Empire and the 
native Nords. The player 
will have to choose a side sooner or later, which will have great impact on 
the game-world. Besides these two dominating factions, the player also has the 
opportunity to join &quot;less popular&quot; factions on the side, like &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; 
or the &quot;Thieves Guild&quot;, which can also impact the main world, or at 
least how the world reacts to the player.<br>
As in any other RPG, development of the character has an essential role in 
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. However, the character is not pre-destined to any &quot;class&quot;, as in many 
other RPG's. The character is developed via skills, which result in very 
differentiated styles and game-play. The system works extremely well, providing 
individuality and specialization possibilities to every type of player.<br>
The story takes place 200 years after the ending of Oblivion, the previous Elder Scrolls 
game, but in the province of Skyrim instead of Cyrodiil. As all the 
earlier Elder Scrolls games, the player is free to roam as he/she pleases. The 
world is a huge sandbox with an incredible amount of possibilities.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px">
Tamriel, also known as &quot;Dawn's Beauty&quot; or &quot;Starry Heart&quot;, is one of several 
continents on the planet Nirn (Also known as Mundus). Tamriel is where all The 
Elder Scrolls games take place, at least so far. The Elder Scrolls Online will 
combines all provinces of Tamriel in time, including Skyrim. Nirn is a mortal realm, which is 
connected to the immortal realms of Oblivion. During The Elder Scrolls IV: 
Oblivion, &quot;Mankar Camoran&quot; speaks of Tamriel as an extension of the Oblivion 
realm, but as he is the only Daedric prince who claims this, it could just be 
&quot;stories&quot; from the Mythic Dawn.</p>
<p align="center">
<a target="_blank" href="../gfx/tamriel_map.jpg">
<img border="0" src="../gfx/tamriel_map_tn.jpg"></a></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px">
Tamriel is about 12 million square kilometers, and is 
divided into 9 provinces.<br>
Skyrim, High Rock, Hammerfell, Summerset Isle, Valenwood, Elsweyr, Black Marsh, 
Morrowind, and Cyrodiil.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 6px; margin-left: 6px">
<b><br>
Cyrodiil</b> (Also known as the Heartlands) is the center of the Human race, and 
home to 
the empire. It is the largest of the provinces, and is mostly jungle. The 
Imperial City is in the heartland, by the Nibenay Valley. The central valley is 
surrounded by rain forests, which face the swamps of Argonia and the Topal Bay. 
The land rises to the west and the north, where it borders Skyrim. Between the 
western coast and the central valley, lay huge forests and swamps. This is where 
The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, takes place.<br>
<br>
<b>Morrowind</b> is the homeland of the Dunmer. (Dark Elves) The province is 
located to the far north of Tamriel. Most of it's population is living around 
the high uplands, and the river valleys of central Morrowind. In the Inner Sea, 
the island Vvardenfell is dominated by the Red Mountain volcano and ash 
wastelands. This is where The Elder Scrolls III takes place.<br>
<br>
<b>Black Marsh</b> is located by the great inland waterways and swamps to the 
south. Most travel is by boat, as there a only very few roads. The coasts and 
northwestern forests are mostly uninhabited. For ages, the Dark Elves have 
raided the Black Marsh for slaves. Even though the Empire has made it illegal, 
they continue to do so, which is the main reason for hatred between the 
Argonians and the Dunmer.<br>
<br>
<b>Elsweyr </b>is mainly jungles and river basins, inhabited by the Khajiit. 
They are city dwellers with tradition for trade. To the north of Elsweyr, 
nomadic tribal Khajiit live in the wastes and grasslands. They are more 
aggressive and territorial, and united under tribal warlords. The settled 
Khajiit to the south, quickly adopted to the ways of the Empire, but the 
northern tribes still keep to their barbaric ways.<br>
<br>
<b>Valenwood</b> is a large forest wilderness, mostly uninhabited. The coasts of 
Valenwood have swamps and tropical rain forests. This is where the Bosmer (Wood 
Elves) live in small timber houses. They have small settlements scattered along 
the coast, only connected by trails. There are a few Imperial roads, but they only 
have tiny settlements, and very low trade and traffic activity.<br>
<br>
<b>The Summerset Isle</b> is a green place with fertile farmlands, woods, and 
old towers and manors. Most settlements are small and isolated, mostly seats by 
wizard or warlord. The Isle has a few natural ports, but foreigners are usually 
not welcome. The Aldmer who lives here, are little affected by the Empire.<br>
<br>
<b>High Rock </b>is the land of the Bretons. The land has 3 main locations: The 
Dellese Isles, the Bjoulsae River, and the Western Reach. The highland 
strongholds and the valley settlements have encouraged independence of the many 
Breton clans. Their language, traditions, and legends are holding the people 
together in tradition and spirit.<br>
<br>
<b>Hammerfell </b>is an urban and maritime province. The Elder Scrolls II: 
Daggerfall, takes place here. Most of the population is gathering in the cities 
of Sentinel and Stros M'Kai. The rest of the country has a thin population, 
living in small poor farm houses. Hammerfell is home to the Redguards, who love 
of travel, and go on adventures. Many Redquards are sailors, mercenaries, and 
adventurers all around Tamriel.<br>
<br>
<b>Skyrim</b>, also known as the &quot;Old Kingdom&quot; or &quot;Fatherland&quot;, was the first 
region of Tamriel to be settled by humans from Altmora. The Nords are 
hardy, brave, and fearless people with strong traditions and beliefs. They are 
excellent warriors and traders. They are far more civilized than their 
barbarian ancestors, but war and exploration still remains essential to the Nords. This is where The Elder Scrolls V takes place.<br>
<br>
Legend say that the first humans came to Tamriel from the continent of Altmora 
in the late Second Era. It was not a single invasion, but a series over hundreds 
of years, developing the Nords, Imperials and the Bretons.<br>
<br>
<br>
As in the previous Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim begins with the player as an 
unknown prisoner. This time the player was caught in an Imperial ambush on the 
Stormcloak rebels, while attempting to cross the border into Skyrim. The 
Stormcloak leader, Ulfric Stormcloak, was among the captured. Everyone, except 
for the player, is scheduled for execution, but an Imperial commander decides 
that the player is to be executed as well. As the player is about to be 
beheaded, a black dragon shows up and attacks everyone. The player can choose to 
escape the chaos along with either a Stormcloak rebel or an Imperial soldier 
who will guide the player to a nearby town. Everything from here is completely 
up to the player. The world of Skyrim is completely open for exploration and adventure.</p>

Skyrim was planned shortly after the release of Oblivion in 2006, but serious 
development didn't start until 2008. The developer team was made up of about 100 
people, both new and &quot;veterans&quot; from previous games. The production was 
supervised by Todd Howard, who has directed many of Bethesda's titles.<br>
Skyrim is made on Bethesda's Creation Engine, which was created shortly before 
Skyrim. The Creation Engine has several graphical improvements compared to 
Bethesda's previous engines. For example, improved drawing distance. Dynamic 
lighting, enhanced flora (No more SpeedTree), enhanced weather effects, like 
dynamic snow, and better animation (Provided by Havok). The engine still uses 
the Radiant AI system (created for Oblivion), but slightly upgraded. The Special 
Edition engine introduces more improvements, and a new 64bit structure which 
takes better advantage of newer hardware.<br>
<br>
The world of Skyrim is similar in size to Oblivion's world (Cyrodiil), but the 
mountains make it more difficult to get around. The design of the Skyrim world 
has a more &quot;surrealistic&quot; style, contrary to Oblivion's classic 
medieval-European fantasy style. This makes the world more interesting to 
explore, just like Morrowind was. Skyrim is divided into nine locations (Holds), which have each their own environmental setting, and people. Especially 
the diversity of the people makes the players choice of race interesting. 
Different factions in the game will react differently depending on the players 
choice of race, and upon which side of the civil war the player chooses, and 
which smaller factions the player chooses to join, if any. To make the people of Skyrim even more unique, over 70 voice actors 
has been used, 
including Max von Sydow, Christopher Plummer, Joan Allen, Lynda Carter, Michael 
Hogan, and Vladimir Kulich.</p>
