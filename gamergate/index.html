Hollywood and the dinosaur-media has been infested with woke lies and hypocrisy 
for years, and the result clearly show. Both have seen a dramatic drop in 
quality and credibility, to the point where most people have given up on the 
cinema, and less than 20% trust the news-media. The woke mob also tried 
infesting the gaming industry with their lies, 
but this lead to a massive backlash under the name of #GamerGate.</font></p>

<font size="6" face="Impact">HISTORY OF GAMERGATE</font><font face="Arial" size="6"><b><br>
</b></font><font face="Arial" size="4">What 
is GamerGate and how did it come about</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">In 2014 a couple of gamers noticed that <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">
Depression Quest</a></b>, a text-based game, got overwhelmingly good reviews 
at <b><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/">Kotaku</a></b>. This was strange, as the game 
was no more than an interactive novel, and it 
didn't get one single good review/comment from gamers (non-critics). So why did the media even notice this game?<br>
Well, it was discovered that the developer, <b>
<a target="_blank" href="http://thisisvideogames.com/gamergatewiki/index.php/Zoe_Quinn">Zoë Quinn</a></b>, 
had been sleeping with the game journalist who was reviewing the game. (<a target="_blank" href="https://archive.is/MeIYt">LINK</a>) This of 
course raised legitimate concerns about the integrity of Kotaku, and people 
started looking into more questionable reviews in the gaming 
press.<b><br>
</b><br>
As more people began researching, more and more strange reviews and articles 
were found, and people started calling it out. <b>The media fought back by 
calling all gamers misogynists, bigots, racists, Nazi's. All the usual slurs 
that today have lost all meaning. </b>Inappropriate and uncalled for, so more gamers joined the 
&quot;debate&quot;, and discovered that quite a few media-outlets had been 
infested with woke lies. #GamerGate united the gamers who wanted to callout the 
corruption and lack of ethics, and they gave the media an overwhelming backlash. 
The media responded by pretending to be victims, and started writing 
articles to smear and discredit #GamerGate. <b>Zoë Quinn <i>claims</i> 
to have received an excessive amount of online harassment and threats at that 
time, but has no credible sources or documentation to back up her claims.</b></font></p>

<p align="left">
<font face="Arial"><b>
<a target="_blank" href="http://thisisvideogames.com/gamergatewiki/index.php/Anita_Sarkeesian">
Anita Sarkeesian</a></b>, feminist co-writer of <b>
<a target="_blank" href="https://feministfrequency.com">Feminist Frequency</a></b> 
and host of the short video series <b>
<a target="_blank" href="https://feministfrequency.com/series/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games/">
Tropes vs. Women</a></b>, claimed that she too was harassed and threatened 
online. (Also without credible sources or documentation)<br>
<b>
<a target="_blank" href="http://thisisvideogames.com/gamergatewiki/index.php/Brianna_Wu">
Brianna Wu</a></b>, founder of <b>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.giantspacekat.com/">Giant Spacekat</a></b> 
and creator of feminist game: <b>
<a target="_blank" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/350200/Revolution_60/">
Revolution 60</a></b>, was very outspoken against GamerGate, and also claimed to 
have received online harassment and threats. (Again, without credible sources or 
documentation)<br>
<br>
The gaming media praised these 3 individuals: Zoë Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian and 
Brianna Wu, and told their stories, as if they were super-talented brave women, 
fighting against an industry of evil misogynistic, bigoted, racist, 
Nazi-white-men. Their stories even spread to regular media, where they were 
admired and praised, without anyone ever looking into why these 3 woman got bad 
critique for their products. The media only focused on making up a narrative about the 3 strong 
independent 
women, and their fight against the mob of evil white men. The media claimed that the ONLY reason why Zoë's and Briana's games got bad user-ratings, 
were because Zoë and Briana were women. Nothing could of course be further from the truth. <b>Take one 
good look at Zoë Quinn's &quot;Depression Quest&quot; or Brianna Wu's &quot;Revolution 60&quot;, and 
it's crystal clear why they got bad reviews.</b> Both games are 
simply terrible, which is the reason why they received bad reviews from gamers, just 
like any other terrible game would. It's as simple as that. <b>The gaming-media 
gave these horrible games overwhelmingly good reviews, which looks (a lot) like they 
were more interested in pushing woke lies, than writing objective and genuine 
game-reviews.</b><br>
<br>
Anita Sarkeesian, the woman behind &quot;Tropes vs. Women&quot;, which looks like a professional show at first 
glance, actually appears presentable, and she is well spoken. But the claims that she makes in her videos 
are false and 
seemingly random, but she looks professional, and you have to know the content 
she is talks about, to see through her. To start off her project, she launched a 
donation campaign for the production of her videos. <b>She receives a lot of money 
from her feminist audience at Feminist Frequency, and to keep the money coming, she needed to make content that 
would fit the feminist narrative.</b> In contrast to Anita's claims, the videos 
and examples of games that she shows, are not made by herself. It's just video's she found 
online, which she speaks on top of. *Evidence in the videos below. As she doesn't 
appear mentally challenged, even though her statements are nothing short of crazy, 
it would seem (a 
lot) like she is a scam-artist, who keeps doing what she does, as long 
as she can fool feminists into throwing money at her.</font></p>

<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">In 2015, Zoë Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian went 
one step further. <b>They literally went to the UN, taking time away from <i>
real</i> issues, to convince the UN to enforce censorship of criticism, and deem 
any disagreement with woke feminist ideology &quot;hate-speech&quot;.</b> And what's 
even more crazy: The UN actually let them speak! Taking time to discuss &quot;mean tweets&quot;, 
at a time where people faced ethnic cleansing by the &quot;religion of piece&quot;. 
Absolutely insane. It says a lot about the UN. 
Free speech is fine of course, but the UN <i>should</i> prioritize real issues, 
of which there are plenty, instead of entertaining complete utter nonsense. See articles: <b>
<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@Doomskander/many-of-you-are-no-doubt-aware-that-recently-anita-sarkeesian-and-zoe-quinn-went-to-the-un-to-de74275535a9">
Anita &amp; Zoë at the UN</a> -
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/25/u-n-womens-group-calls-for-web-censorship/">
The UN Wants To Censor The Internet To Save Feminists’ 
Feelings</a></b><br>
<br>
The UN's report: Cyber Violence against women and girls: (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2015/cyber_violence_gender%20report.pdf?v=1&d=20150924T154259">LINK</a>)<br>
Anyone who has ever used social media, or anyone who knows what the internet is, 
can easily debunk the entire report. It's absolutely mind-blowing how a 
council of people can come up with something this absurd. In my opinion, this is 
enough grounds to discontinue the existence of the UN.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial">..And things get even more bizarre..</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">Not long after Anita &amp; Zoë's charade at the UN, Candace Owens, better known as <b>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL0u5uz7KZ9q-pe-VC8TY-w">
Red Pill Black</a></b>, not knowing anything about GamerGate, launched a 
kick-starter for a project about anti-bullying. Something that 
Zoë Quinn and the other &quot;victims&quot; of bad reviews should be excited 
about. But watch the first 10 minutes of the following video, and be amazed.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial"><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSAoitd1BTQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">The phrase, <b>&quot;we are lifting the masks off trolls&quot;</b>, 
which sounds like, <b>&quot;exposing the identity of online harassers&quot;</b>, made Zoë 
Quinn panic. Now why would Zoë Quinn panic over something that would help her 
expose all the anonymous white men, that she claims were harassing her? 
Another good question is how she knows they were all white men, if they ware all 
anonymous? Anyway, as Candace Owens didn't want to stop her project, even after being 
threatened by Zoë Quinn, all of a sudden, all these &quot;anonymous white men&quot; 
started attacking Candace Owens, literally right after she spoke with Zoë on the phone. 
To Candace Owens, and many others, this would seem (a lot) like Zoë Quinn 
actually controls all these fake profiles, and uses them to harass&nbsp; people. <b>It would 
seem (an awful lot) like Zoë Quinn actually 
never was harassed online, but that she herself was/is the harasser.</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://thisisvideogames.com/gamergatewiki/index.php/Mike_Cernovich">More 
evidence to this fact</a>) It would definitely seem like she had just made the whole thing up so she could play the 
victim, and use <i>
that as </i>the reason why her game got bad reviews, and not her lack of competence. That, and 
so she could collect donations on her <b>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/zoe">Patreon</a></b> from 
gullible woke feminists of course.</font></p>

<font face="Arial">This interview with Yuri Bezmenov, a KGB defector, has 
nothing to do with GamerGate as such, but it explains perfectly how the world 
came to this.<br>
It's recorded in the 1980s, where he warned about what the KGB was actually 
doing to the US and other countries. It's a very interesting interview, and it's 
highly relevant for understanding current events in the US and EU.</font></p>
